//Question#6 Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
// for \t
var myname = "\tSufyan\t";
console.log(myname);
//for \n
var othername = "\nSufyan Yaseen\n";
console.log(othername);
//Question#7 Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results.
//Addition
var nmbr1 = 2;
var nmbr2 = 6;
var sum = nmbr1 + nmbr2;
console.log(sum);
//Subtraction
var nmbr3 = 12;
var nmbr4 = 4;
var subtract = nmbr3 - nmbr4;
console.log(subtract);
//Multiplication
var nmbr5 = 4;
var nmbr6 = 2;
var multiply = nmbr5 * nmbr6;
console.log(multiply);
//Division
var nmbr7 = 80;
var nmbr8 = 10;
var divide = nmbr7 / nmbr8;
console.log(divide);
//Question#8 You should create four lines that look like this:
//console.log(5 + 3)
//Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.
console.log(5 + 3);
console.log(12 - 4);
console.log(4 * 2);
console.log(80 / 10);
//Question# 9 Favorite Number: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.
