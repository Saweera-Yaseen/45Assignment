//Question#12 Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let fvrtfrnd=["Faiza, Rafia, Hina"];
for (let frnds of fvrtfrnd)
{console.log("Dear",frnds,"Thank you for joining us today")};

//Question#13 Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let transportation= ["Tesla Model S", "Honda CBR1000RR"]
for (let message of transportation)
{console.log("vehicle",message, "I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.")};

//Question#14 Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guests=["Ashfaq, Erum,Faiza"];
for (let guest of guests);
{console.log("Dear" ,guests,"I would like to invite you at dinner")}
